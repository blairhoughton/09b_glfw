## 09b_glfw

## Synopsis

09b_glfw is an application to demonstrate use of GLFW and OpenGL.
It opens a window and animates a number of rotating pyramids.

## Motivation

This project was written from the ground up to understand the
operation of GLFW 3 and OpenGL 2, and to design an object-oriented
methodology for OpenGL programming. There are a number of other programs
that were written in that process, hence the funny program name. OpenGL2 was
an easy entry into graphics programming but is deprecated, and this code
will eventually be ported to WebGL.

## Installation

Copy the code, go into the code directory, and type

	make

on the command line. The executable will be in the current directory.

## Running

Type

	./09b_glfw

on the command line to execute the program.

## Contributors

This code does not need maintaining at this time.
